  ## About
  Using Node, this app allows a manager to outline their company and track each employee's department, role, and salary, enabling them to reassign employees as necessary.
  ## Installation
  In order to use this app, you will need to have Node installed. In your command line change directory to the Develop folder and run an `npm install`. This will install all necessary npm packages to successfully run this app. In order for this app to function properly, launch a mySQL database with the installed schema running.
  ## Usage
  After installing all necessary packages, run `node tracker.js`. Follow the menu elements to Add a new Department, Role, or Employee.

To View a Department, Role, or Employee, select the View option on the Main Menu then select the respective option. To Modify an employee's role, select the Modify button on the Main Menu, select the employee you want to adjust, then select the role they should be relocated to. After doing so, you will be able to see their Role_ID changed to the appropriate position in the View->Employee menu selection.
